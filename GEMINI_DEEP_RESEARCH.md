# Gemini Deep Research Plan: Iceland Trip April 2026 (Round 2)

## Context
- **Who:** 7 Adults (Max group size).
- **When:** April 8–17, 2026 (10 Days).
- **Style:** Adventure, Photography, Comfortable Pace.
- **Vehicles:** 2x 4WD or 1x 9-Seater Van.

## Objectives
The itinerary is solid, but "last mile" details are missing. The focus of this research is **actionable logistics** and **enhancing specific days**.

## Research Tasks

### 1. Dining Logistics for 7 People 🍽️
*   **Hvolsvöllur Area (Days 2 & 5):** We are staying here twice (Spuni & Stora Mork).
    *   Find 2-3 dinner options that can accommodate 7 people. (e.g., Valhalla Restaurant, Gamla Fjósið - are they open in April? Do they take bookings?)
    *   *Self-Catering:* Where is the best grocery store specifically in Hvolsvöllur vs. Hella?
*   **Vík (Day 3):**
    *   Besides "Soup Company," what is a slightly upscale dinner option in Vík for a group celebration? (e.g., Black Crust Pizzeria vs. Berg Restaurant).
*   **Stykkishólmur (Day 7):**
    *   Verify if "Sjávarpakkhúsið" require reservations months in advance for groups.

### 2. Activity Specifics & Booking 🏔️
*   **Glacier Hike (Day 3 - Sólheimajökull):**
    *   Identify the top-rated operator for a "easy/moderate" glacier walk (2-3 hours).
    *   What are the specific start times in April? (Need to fit itinerary: 12:00-15:00 window).
*   **Blue Lagoon (Day 9):**
    *   Verify the "Comfort" vs "Premium" package necessity. Does the premium line skip a significant queue in April?

### 3. Trail & Road Conditions (April Realities) 🚶
*   **Múlagljúfur Canyon (Day 4):**
    *   Confirm the trailhead access. Is the gravel road passable for standard 4WD in April?
    *   Trail stats: Length, elevation gain, expected mud conditions.
*   **Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge (Day 8):**
    *   Is the interior accessible in mid-April, or is it typically blocked by a snow wall?
*   **F-Roads/Gravel:**
    *   Verify status of the road to **Haifoss** (is it feasible to add to Day 5 return trip?). It's often closed/snowed in.

### 4. "Hidden Gems" to Add (The "Wow" Factor) ✨
*   **Day 5 (Return Drive Vík -> Hvolsvöllur):**
    *   This day is light. Find a stop between Vík and Hvolsvöllur that isn't Skógafoss/Seljalandsfoss.
    *   *Ideas to check:* Keldur Turf Houses (open?), Nauthúsagil (accessible?).
*   **Day 6 (Borgarnes Area):**
    *   Find a "Visit" stop near Borgarnes before the hotel. (e.g., Settlement Center - is it worth it? Glanni Waterfall?)

### 5. Practical Fees 💰
*   **Parking Map:** Create a list of which planned stops now have **mandatory paid parking** and if they require an app (Parka, Easypark).
    *   List: Thingvellir, Seljalandsfoss, Skógafoss, Reynisfjara, Skaftafell, Kirkjufell.
