## Research Tasks

### 1. Culinary Deep Dive 🍽️
*   **Friðheimar (Day 2):** Beyond the soup, are there other must-try items on the menu (e.g., tomato beer, desserts)? Do we need to book *months* in advance for April 2026?
*   **Ölverk (Day 6):** What are their signature pizzas or brews that are unique to Iceland?
*   **Bjargarsteinn (Day 8):** What is the "can't miss" dish here? (e.g., fish soup, lamb).
*   **Vík & Borgarnes:** We need 1-2 solid dinner recommendations for these towns that aren't tourist traps.

### 2. Hidden Gems & Photo Spots 📸
*   **South Coast:** Are there any less crowded waterfalls or viewpoints between Skógafoss and Vík? (e.g., Kvernufoss - is it accessible in April?)
*   **Snæfellsnes:** Any "secret" spots near Arnarstapi or Hellnar for sunset photography?
*   **Route 1 Stops:** Interesting quick stops (abandoned houses, unique geological formations) to break up the longer drives on Days 4 and 5.

### 3. Practical Logistics 🛒
*   **Supermarkets:** Map out the best *Bónus* or *Krónan* locations along our specific route for stocking up. (Specifically: where is the last big grocery store before heading east to Jökulsárlón?)
*   **Parking:** Which of our stops require paid parking (via Parka app)? (e.g., Seljalandsfoss, Kirkjufell, Thingvellir).

### 4. Weather Backups 🌧️
*   **South Coast (Days 3-5):** If the weather is terrible (horizontal rain/wind), what are the best *indoor* museums or activities in the Vík/Skógar area? (e.g., Lava Centre, Skógar Museum details).

### 5. Aurora Hunting 💚
*   **Specific Spots:** For our accommodation locations (Hvolsvöllur, Hali, Borgarnes), where are the specific dark spots or pull-offs within 10 minutes driving that offer good foregrounds for photos?
